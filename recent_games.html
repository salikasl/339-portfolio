            <h2 class="ucla_title">Michigan vs UCLA (49 - 51)</h2>
            <p class="ucla_summary">This game was a close one and low scoring one, with UCLA leading most of the time. UCLA was led my Johnny Juzang, who scored more than half their points that night. Michigan brought it close during the last few minutes, but after a time scramble and a few missed shots from Wagner and Mike Smith, the Wolverines were unfortunately beaten and taken out of Final Four contention. Until next year's March Madness.</p>

            <h2 class="lsu_title">Michigan vs LSU (86 - 78)</h2>
            <p class="lsu_summary">This game was truly a nail biter - the lead was always flipping between the two teams and Michigan was at one point down by more than 9 in the first half. The Wolverines survived an upset scare from a hot LSU Tigers team. Michigan was able to clinch their spot in the Sweet 16 thanks in large part to Chaundee Brown's 21 points off the bench.</p>
